# Aim :

This project was our first Bootcamp Project and was focused on applying our newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch.

With a team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Working collaboratively, we learned agile development methodologies, debugged and implemented various features using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

# Project Description:

A webpage that allows a user to search an artist, song or genre that they like, and then generate a playlist of similar songs through a Spotify API. The user will be able to define how long they would like the playlist to be. The webpage also features a "Recommended Cocktail" button, which, when clicked, will present the user with the name and instructions for a random cocktail that they can enjoy while listening to their new playlist.

# User Story:

[type of user...] As someone who is interested in music and always looking to hear new songs, [goal...] I want to easily be presented with a list of songs based off music I already know and enjoy [to achieve...] in order to expand my music experience and discover new music.
